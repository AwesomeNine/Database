## ðŸ“ƒ About Database

This package is an expressive query builder for WordPress, it ease the SQL generation and takes care of sanitization of data as well.

### Data Sanitisation

The purpose of this library is to provide an **expressive** and **safe*** way
to run queries against your WordPress database (typically involving custom tables).

To this end all **values** provided are escaped, but note that **column and table**
names are not yet escaped. In any case, even if they were you should be whitelisting
any allowed columns/tables: otherwise using user-input, or other untrusted data to
determine the column/table could allow an attacker to retrieve data they shouldn't
or generate a map of your database.
